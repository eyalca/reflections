When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
This should be relevant when I'm not always working on a project from the same comuter, or when I'm not working on aproject alone

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
The reason may be that changes made in the remote repository might conflict with the local one, and I would like to have control over what I pull and push manually

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks are to utilize someone elses repositoy without interffering with their original project at all but with clear trace of the repository's origin showing that this is an edited version of the original project.
clones are for a case where I would like to work on a repository locally without any connection to the original project and choose to push or not based on my will
branches are for working on the same project in parallel as collaborators or by the same person but on differnt parts of it, such as new features, experiments etc.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
the benefit would be to allow working on the latest version of the porject offline with the smallest effect on manual merging when done.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
I could collborate on a shared storage or cloud strorgaes (dropbox). this might make the sharing easier, but there would be no workflow, no merging option or conflicts management
